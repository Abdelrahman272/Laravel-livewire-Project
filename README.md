Project Description:
I've developed a Laravel project that leverages the power of Livewire, a package for building dynamic, real-time web applications in Laravel. This project consists of both an admin panel and a user interface, allowing users to perform various CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. It also incorporates real-time validation for an enhanced user experience.

Key Features:

Admin and User Pages:

The project includes two distinct interfaces: an admin panel and a user interface. These interfaces cater to different user roles and provide the necessary functionality.
CRUD Operations:

Create: Users can add new records or items, such as articles, products, or any data that your application deals with. Livewire simplifies the process of handling form submissions and data persistence.

Read: The application allows users to view a list of existing records or details about a specific item. Livewire makes it easy to retrieve and display data from your database.

Update: Users can modify and update the information of existing records. Livewire handles form submissions and data updates, providing a seamless editing experience.

Delete: The project enables users to delete records when they are no longer needed. Livewire facilitates this operation, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

Real-time Validation:

Real-time validation is an essential feature of this project. It ensures that user input is validated and feedback is provided instantly without the need to submit the form. Livewire dynamically checks for errors and displays error messages to users, creating a more user-friendly experience.
